        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Blooming Oasis! We are a passionate team of plant enthusiasts dedicated to helping you bring
            nature into your home. Our mission is to make your plant journey simple, enjoyable, and environmentally
            conscious.</p>

        <!-- Founder Story -->
        <section id="founder-story">
            <h2>Our Founder’s Passion</h2>
            <p>Our founder, Nazmul Hassan, has always had a deep love for plants. From a young age, they found solace
                in nature, spending hours tending to their childhood garden. As an adult, they realized that the calming
                power of plants could be shared with others. This inspired them to create Blooming Oasis – a space where
                everyone, from seasoned plant parents to beginners, can discover and grow plants that brighten their
                homes.</p>
            <p>With a focus on sustainability and eco-conscious practices, Nazmul Hassan set out to curate a
                collection of plants that not only thrive in indoor spaces but are sourced with care for the
                environment. Blooming Oasis was born out of this commitment to make greenery more accessible and promote
                a greener, healthier lifestyle for all.</p>

        <!-- Eco-Friendly Sourcing -->
        <section id="eco-friendly-sourcing" class="mt-5">
            <h2>Eco-Friendly Sourcing Practices</h2>
            <p>At Blooming Oasis, we believe in responsible plant cultivation and packaging. Our sourcing practices are
                designed to minimize our environmental impact and support sustainable businesses.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Eco-Friendly Packaging:</strong> We use 100% recyclable or biodegradable materials for
                    packaging to reduce waste and keep our planet green.</li>
                <li><strong>Sustainable Plant Cultivation:</strong> Our plants are sourced from nurseries that
                    prioritize organic, non-toxic, and sustainable growing practices. We ensure that each plant is
                    cultivated with care, using practices that protect the environment and support biodiversity.</li>
                <li><strong>Local Sourcing:</strong> Whenever possible, we collaborate with local growers to reduce our
                    carbon footprint and support small, sustainable businesses in the community.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We are constantly striving to improve our practices and continue learning how to be better stewards of
                the planet. Sustainability is at the heart of everything we do, and we are committed to bringing nature
                indoors in the most eco-friendly way possible.</p>
